layout: post
title: The basic for publish post in github with markdown
---

For publish in *github* I only need to remember a few basics ideas.

The **name of file** will be yyyy-mm-dd-name.md and I create a new file 
from de web in the folder _post.

At the top of the post I write **tree dashes** '---' and the tags **layout** (post) and
the **title** tag and a new line wit another tree dashes.

I use **markdown**, that it's very simple

- a word between **one** asterisc = italic.
- a word between **two** asterisc = bold.
- For **hyperlink** I only have to use ˋ[title](link)ˋ .
- For a **image** the same that before but write ˋ|' at the first.

For title or leves I use one, two or therre ˋ#ˋ at the start of the line.

I made a folder in _post. I called images and I upload the images there.
Then, when I published I only need to write the path that is 
ˋ/images/name-of-file.png
