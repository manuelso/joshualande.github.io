title: New Blog with Tablet
---

Today I start a new blog with github. Now I am using only a tablet. I was looking for a minimalist theme and I found a theme o
f
Jhousa that I like.

I was thinking were tu publish and I prefer to use **github** because is quickly and he doesn't have adversiment.

I testid on my mobile phone and you can see well.

I only need a web browser on android and I can use *markdown*.
