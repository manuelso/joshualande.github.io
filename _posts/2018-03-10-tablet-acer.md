title: My new acer tablet
---

I was using a netbook from the last 5 years. An Acer Aspire One. But the netbook was
very noisy. I don't have a lot o money and I was thinking... If I only surf the web,
 read some artile, watch some videos why I have to pay more money?
 
 I shoped and Acer Aspie One Tablet 10". The cost was 169 euros. The tablet has a
 otg port and I can connect a mouse, I can connect an usb keyboard, a pen drive.
 
 My screen netbook had a 10" screen that it's the same of my new tablet. I am using 
 my new tablet from one month ago and it's very confortable. Now I don't hear any noise. 
 I prefer listen relax music but not the fan of the computer.
 
 Some people think that it's a fool thing, but I can read email, browse, check my ideas with 
 *Trello* and publish in my blog with *github*. I don't need more. I am practising
 minimalism from several years ago and this element it's perfect for me.
 
 Some characteristics are:
 
 - 2 GB Ram
 - OTG port (for conect usb elements).
 - 16 GB space (but with Android you only have about 7 GB free).
 - two speakers in the front (one on the left, another in the right).
 - battery for 10 hours per day.
 - bluetooh and wifi.
 - HD images.
